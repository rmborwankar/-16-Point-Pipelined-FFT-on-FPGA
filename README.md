# 16-POINT PIPELINED FFT IMPLEMENTATION ON FPGA
A Radix-2 16 point pipelined FFT using MATLAB and Xilinx IP core.

Proposed System
There are various algorithms to implement the pipeline FFT viz, Radix 2 multipath delay commutator, Radix 2 single path delay feedback, Radix 4 multipath delay commutator, Radix 4 single path delay feedback, Radix 4 single path delay commutator and Radix 22 single path delay feedback. The proposed system uses Radix 2 multipath delay commutator to implement the pipelined FFT.
